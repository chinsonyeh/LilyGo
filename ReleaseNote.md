# v1.1.0
Date: 2025-06-21

### Main Updates

- The main program has been renamed from `LilyGo.py` to `LilyGo.pyw`, so launching will no longer open a command prompt window.
- Added automatic version checking. A button is now available in the GUI to download and update to the latest version automatically.
- Improved button enable/disable logic to prevent conflicting operations and enhance user experience.
